## Parse output of aconnect -l to make a list of all MIDI connections  that
## 120Proof can use.  There is no accessible documentation for the format
## of this output.

## Use multiple passes of the data:

## The data is divided into client records.
## Each client record starts with /^client (\d+):[^\[]+\[([^\]]+)\]$/
## The client number is $1.
## $2 is an array.  The first entry is "type=<type>". Types can be kernel,
## or user.  If there is a second argument it is "pid=<PID>" where the
## process that owns this is PID, or "card=<Card number>" which matches a
## device attached to the computer.

## The client records are divided into port records.
## Each port record starts with /^\s+(\d+)\s\'([^\']+)$/.
## $1 is the port number.  The deviceID is "<device number>:<port number>"
## uniquely describe one end of a MIDI connection.

## Each port record has 0, 1, or 2 lines /^\s+Connected From: \[(.+)\]/ or
## /^\s+Connecting To: \[(.+)\]/.
## $1 are devices "<device number>:<port number>".  For device "128:0"
## sometimes it is: "128:0[real:0]".


## Parse 1.  Build an array of port records for clients with a PID or card. .  (Just the connecting To lines will be enough).  In each record store device number, port number, PID or card, and connecting to line.  Subsequent parses are over this array

## Parse 2: Get the devceID of every client record with a PID or card number.
## Put these in @device_ids 

## Parse 3: For every port record with a deviceID $prID where $prID is in  @device_ids, evry deviceID in the ConectingTo line, $clID, if $clID is in @deviceIDs then "$prID $clID" is a connection that 120Proof cares about.
