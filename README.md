# 120Proof

Idiosyncratic music making system.

Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi using a [Pisound](https://blokas.io/pisound/) card

Two Approaches.

1. Process Audio
2. Route MIDI

## Processing Audio

Use [JACK Audio Connection Kit](https://github.com/jackaudio) to route audio from a sound card through an effects chain.

The effects chain is made from  LV2 simulators.  Uses [Modep](https://blokas.io/modep/) to build the virtual pedal boards and effect chains

The programme `bin/run` reads the `Modep`  configuration  files and loads the simulators into memory.  The `Jack` connections are made between the simulators,  but not the connections to the input and output.  In the directory `120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/` it leaves a file for each pedal described in `Modep` that describes the input and output Jack connections to make to enable that "pedal board".  These description files are named for the names assigned the "pedal boards" in `Modep`.

The programme in `Pedal/midi_driver/` acts as a driver for a MIDI pedal (currently only one MIDI pedal SINCO is supported).  Depressing a key on the SINCO pedal (there are four) reads the `Jack` connections from one of four files in `120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/` (`120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/A` to `120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/D`) that are symbolic links to one of the files created by `120Proof/bin/run`. 

Creating links in `120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/` is how each MIDI pedal is assigned to a "pedal board"

### The Guitar Tuner

`120Proof/bin/run` starts [`gxtuner`](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gxtuner) and connects it to the `Jack` inputs.  When started using the `Pisound` button  (see below) it is the only window open.

### Integration with Pisound

The `Pisound` card has a physical button.  It can be assigned various functions for single, double, and more, "clicks".

Press the button once starts `120Proof` in audio routing (guitar pedal) mode.

Press the button twice and `Modep` is started

To set up the button edit `/usr/local/patchbox-modules/modep/pisound-btn.conf` and edit the two lines:

```
CLICK_1	<path to start script>
CLICK_2	<path to stop script>
```

The script to start `120Proof` in audio processing mode calls the button common script, sets up the `Home120Proof` environment variable, and calls `120Proof/bin/run`

(In this case the default user is left as [`Patchbox-OS`](https://blokas.io/patchbox-os/) set it).


```sh
. /usr/local/pisound/scripts/common/common.sh
export Home120Proof=/home/patch/120Proof
${Home120Proof}/bin/run
```

The script to stop the `120Proof` (and start `Modep`) is:

```sh
. /usr/local/pisound/scripts/common/common.sh
/home/patch/120Proof/bin/stop
```

## Routing MIDI

Process MIDI signals using [ALSA MIDI](https://github.com/opensrc/alsa/blob/master/lib/md/AlsaMidi.md) from input devices and use them to controll [Yoshimi](https://yoshimi.sourceforge.io/) or [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/).

This is still a work in progress and is not being used

## General Setup for All Instrumets/Configurations


The LV2 pedal boards are initialised using `modep-mod-host` and `modep-mod-ui`.  The simulators are initialised and the Jack pipes between them set up.

The Jack conections that connect audio input and output into particular pedal boards are placed in files in "pedal/PEDALS/".  Here they are read by the pedal driver (driver.c) or other software as yet unwritten to swap pedal boards in real time.


1. Use `mod-panel` to run `mod-ui` and set up pedal boards.

2. Run `bin/InitialiseModHost` that sets up `mod-host` simulators, Jack
   pipes and the files (in pedal/PEDALS) to be read by the pedal
   driver.  It reads `modep_commands.txt`.

	* It runs `ExtractModep` to create a file (modep_commands.txt) that lists the mod-host commands to set up the LV2 simulations, the JACK connections between them, and the JACK connections (TODO: and MIDI connections) to activate that pedal board

	* In the file `modep_commands.txt` each pedal board definition starts with a `NAME ` line

  1. Each line that starts with a `mh ` is a command for mod-host

  2. Each line that starts with a `jack ` defines a Jack connection

  3. In the `Instruments/` directory create a file for an instrument.
     It will be an executable so after it is run the instrument is set
     up

	* It then starts a local version or `mod-host`  (at `~/mod-host/mod-host`)

3. `InitialiseModHost` then runs `ModhostSimulators`.  Its job is to set up the LV2 simulators  using `mod-host`,  Jack pipes between them, and the files in `pedal/PEDALS` that the pedal driver will read to change the effects in use.

4. Start `lpx_control`.  This monitors the MIDI control signals from the LPX and runs programmes in response that set up the system for use.  `lpx_control` monitors control signals: 19, 29,...,89.  When one of thos buttons s pressed, say 39, the scipt `subs/ON-CTL.39` is run.  Whe another button, say 59 is pressed, `subs/OFF-CTL.39` is run then `subs/ON-CTL.59`.  In this way configurations can be put up and torn down, and there can be up to eight configurations ready to use, live.

The sorts of jobs that `subs/ON-CTL.N` do are:

  * Set up `lpx_manager` to process NIDI from the LPX.
  
  * Set up links in `peal/PEDALS` to establish what effects the pedal controls.
  
  * Set up `yoshimi` (or another synthesiser) to with controls and Jack for audio generation


   This completes the general set up
   
## Setting up a Particular Configuration

Currently there are two MIDI inputs in use and a stereo audio input.  

The stereo input/outputs are to be separated into two separate channels, not done yet.

### Requirements

The MIDI interfaces must be defined.  Currently there are two input
instruments in use, and two possible sinks for MIDI to use to create
initial audio.  The connections are definied in a file that is read by `InitialiseMidi` after the audio generators set up.

The two MIDI controllers are:

1. Lanchpad X.  64 velocity sensitive LED pads.  It appears in the
   MIDI config file as: `Launchpad X:Launchpad X MIDI 2`.

2. Nektar 88 key keyboard.  It appears in the MIDI config file as:
   `Impact LX88+:Impact LX88+ MIDI 1` and `Impact LX88+:Impact LX88+ MIDI 2`

The two MIDI sinks (that produce audio output into Jack) are:

1. Pure Data.  Started with `bin/InitialisePd <instrunent>.pd` where "instrument" defined and is in the file: `pd_patches/instruments/<instrument>.pd`.  For example: `bin/InitialisePd poly_harp_cello.pd`.   There are two MIDI inputs to Pure Data, and the instrument  can use one or both.  For example `pd_patches/instruments/poly_harp_cello.pd` has two simulated instruments:
  1. A harp on input 1
  
  2. A cello on input 2 (17 in Pure Data)
  
The inputs appear in the MIDI configuration file as: `Pure Data:Pure Data Midi-In 1` and `Pure Data:Pure Data Midi-In 1`

2. Yoshimi.  Started with `bin/InitialiseYos <name> <path to
   instrument>`.  Where "name" is an identifier that will be used to
   connect from MIDI and "path to instrument" is the path to an
   instrument definition file.  For examle: `bin/InitialiseYos Midi01
   "/usr/share/yoshimi/banks/Choir_and_Voice/0037-Voiced Synth.xiz"`.
   In this case the MIDI input connection appears in the configuration
   file as: `yoshimi-Midi01:input`.  The Jack output will be (in this
   case) `yoshimi-Midi01`.

###  Pedal

Software for running pedals.

`driver.c` is a not simple enough driver for a foot opeerated USB keyboard with three keys.

`Pedal/midi_driver` is a similar driver for a MIDI pedal

They both operate by changing jack pipes

`Pedal/midi_driver` is a simpler driver for a SINCO specific pedal, and it translates the four switches to four MIDI signals.  By default the pedal can switch between banks.  It gets quite confusng when a bank is accidebtally selected.  This fixes that

Driver

The pedal this was developed with is: `ID 4353:4b4d Jieli Technology SINCO`

* The driver in in `pedal/midi_pedal`
* Converts the four buttons into 'A',...,'D'
* Looks for a configuration file in: $Home120Proof/pedal/PEDALS/
* Named 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'

## Configuration

### MIDI

Two classes of hardware device

1. Musician Interface 

	The device the musician uses.  It requires three connections:
	
	1. MIDI note out
	2. MIDI control out
	3. MIDI control in
	
	The two outputs can be the same MIDI device.
	
	Examples
	
	* a keyboard 
	* Novation LPX

2. Audience Interface.

	The device that the audience listens to.  It requires two connections:
	
	1. MIDI note in
	2. MIDI control in
	
	The two inputs can be the same MIDI device.



## Configuration Files 

For each instrument there is a `midi.cfg` file that 

## Instruments

* Launchpad LPX

	Made by Novation.  A nice grid of LED buttons.  120Proof has custom programmes to control this instrument.

* Pedal

	Essentially a three key USB-keyboard configured as a pedal

  * Look into using a [Behringer FCB1010](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0089) A MIDI foot pedal
  
* Berringer XR18

	Can only be controlled by software

	~/X-Air-LiveToolbox-132-source/X-AIR-Edit_RASPI_1.5/X-AIR-Edit

## InitialiseMidi

Reads a configuration file, the `midi_Connections` section.  The string `/^MIDI_Connections$/` defines the start of the section.

Each non-cmment line is a tab seperated list of two MIDI devices.
Connection from first to second.

Use `aconnect` to ensure that these connections are made and all other cnnections broken

### Invocation

`bin/InitialiseMidi <Config file>`

## lpx_mode

Sets the mode of the `lpx`.  Most useful mode is `127` "Programmer Mode".

## lpx_control

Runs programmes based on the control pad pressed on the LPX 

Programmes (executable files) are placed in the sub directrory `subs/`.  Each control signal can trigger execution of two programmes in `subs/`.  When a control signal is received (say `29`) programme `subs/ON-CTL.29` is run.  When any other control is received, say `39`, `subs/OFF-CTL.29` is run then `subs/ON-39`.

## lpx_colour

Sets the colour of a pad on the `LPX`.

`bin/lpx_colour <Pad> <red> <green> <blue>` where `Pad` in `11..98` and `red`, `green`, and `blue` are in `1..127`. 

## lpx_manager

    Sets up LPX buttons for melodic use. Colouring them with three colours: One for root notes, one for notes on scale, and one for all other notes.
	
	Assign the pads to MIDI notes so that they are aligned in five columns.  This leads to duplication where pads in three leftmost and rightmost columns, in adjacent rows, play the same notes.
	
	When a pad is pressed change its colour (to a fourth colour).  Also change the colour of the other pad that can play this note.

### Invocation

`bin/lpx_manager <Path to MIDI configuration> <Root note MIDI> <root colour> <scale colour> other colour> <[1-12]>`

	Where `<Root note MIDI>` is the MIDI value for the note the center pad (r4, c5) is assigned to.

	`<root colour>`, `<scale colour>`, and `<other colour>` are the colours (from the LPX palette) that are assigned to root notes, scale notes, and other notes respectively.

	`<[1-12]>` is the scale defined as one to twelve integers in the range 1 - 12 inclusive, and ordered, that define the notes of the scale.  Always starts with `1`

* Example

	`bin/lpx_manager 60 1 4 6 8 11` 


   

   
### LPX Setup

* Set mode with: `bin/lpx_mode 127`

* `bin/lpx_manager` needs to know three things:

1. What MIDI devices to send controls to, to receive controls from, and send notes to

2. What the root note is

3. What the scale is

MIDI devices are specified in a file the path to which is the first argument,  The root note (in MIDI, middle C is 60) and a list of integers between 1 and 12, starting with 1, in ascending order, unique as the remaining arguments defines the scale.

### `mod-host`

`InitialiseModHost` starts a local copy of `mod-host` build from Git in `~/mod-host/` running on port 9116.  This means that `MODEP/mod-host` does not need to be stopped.
